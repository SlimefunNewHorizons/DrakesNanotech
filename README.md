# DrakesNanotech

**[Open the complete interactive Field Guide](https://drakescraft-labs.github.io/DrakesNanotech/)**

**Programmable matter. ARC engineering. Gamma science. Cosmic containment.**

DrakesNanotech is an ultra-endgame Slimefun expansion for Minecraft 1.21.11. It builds a long,
interconnected technology tree instead of handing out overpowered toys: recover broken servos,
wind palladium coils, synthesize programmable matter, assemble owner-bound suits, contain gamma
isotopes, and only then begin the six cosmic artifact programs.

The addon is built for servers that want spectacular abilities without accepting grief, random
player kills, invisible attacks, or particle lag.

## Synthezoid Dominion & Graviton Engineering 0.3.0

- **158 registered Slimefun entries:** components, weapons, hero equipment, suits and artifacts plus
  15 fully documented and textured machine heads.
- **Universal Automation Intelligence:** reads any concrete registered Slimefun recipe, prices its
  materials, reserves inputs, consumes energy per powered tick and persists progress. Infinity and
  Singularity targets require at least three real powered days by default. Its output-first commit
  protocol favors a recoverable duplicate over ever deleting irreplaceable materials during a crash.
- **Eight documented multiblocks:** including the 41x41x29 Dying-Star Dyson Foundry and the
  ProtectionStone-sized God-Prison Graviton Cage.
- **Ultron Infinity manifestation:** synthezoid tissue, Vision-derived density architecture,
  six-domain armor, autonomous nanite wings and a bounded extreme particle aureole.
- **Two genuinely different gauntlets:** Stark's simpler nanogauntlet performs the safe PvE Snap
  but kills its carrier after universal discharge; the original Uru gauntlet survives because its
  alloy is melted inside the dying-star foundry.
- **God-Prison flight:** the owner activates survival flight only inside their ProtectionStone,
  consumes physical 4 GJ cells according to real protected volume, and is hard-limited to 20 blocks
  above and 10 below activation altitude. Leaving any boundary revokes flight immediately.
- **Stark technological enchantments:** ARC Aegis VI converts 92% of incoming damage, Nanite
  Regenesis VI consumes Nanomass Canisters to heal and repair equipped armor, and Zero-Point
  Anchor VI rejects one lethal state before a 30-minute cooldown. Enhancements are stored in PDC
  and survive restarts, renames and lore changes.
- **Stark storage network:** three protected 54-slot vaults implement the native Slimefun cargo
  inventory contract. Slimefun Cargo can insert/withdraw directly and Networks can reach them
  through its standard inventory accessors; contents are returned safely when the block breaks.
- **Precision Stark engineering:** micro ARC capacitors, repulsor optics, flight gyros, vectoring
  nozzles, nanite injectors, thermal layers, power buses and servo clusters feed specialized armor.
- **Expanded Iron armor program:** Mark VI, VII, XVII, XXV, XXXVIII, XLVI and LXXXV systems,
  War Machine targeting, Unibeam and pulse-barrier hardware.
- **Kinetic shield program:** shield blank, kinetic matrix, magnetic recall, tactical harness,
  enhancement catalyst and two creature-only returning shields.
- **Infinity Snap:** six orbiting domain colors, escalating resonance, celestial flash, expanding
  rainbow shockwave and layered ash disintegration. It selects a configurable fraction of actual
  Bukkit mobs only—players are structurally impossible targets.
- **Seven branches:** Salvaged Technology, ARC, Nanotech, Gamma, Wakandan Engineering,
  Latverian Techno-Arcana and Cosmic Containment.
- **ARC combat:** the Repulsor Emitter renders a visible cyan ray, impact flash and knockback;
  its target predicate categorically excludes players.
- **Cosmic exposure:** holding any bare Stone starts a clear action-bar countdown, escalating
  distortion and a carrier-only terminal effect. Capsules and gauntlets are the intended answer.
- **Launch suit program:** Mark I, Mark III, Mark V, Mark XLII, Mark L, Hulkbuster and Rescue
  components establish distinct future mechanics instead of cosmetic recolors.
- **Spider program:** Classic, Stealth and Iron Spider suit foundations, Web Shooter, Spider-Sense
  node and articulated waldo modules.
- **Tactical heroes:** Hawkeye smart bow and five arrow systems; Widow's Bite, electroshock baton,
  line launcher and cloaking mesh.
- **Ultron program:** sandboxed AI core, primary shell, sentinel pod, Infinity convergence core and
  a creature-only sky-splitting beam.
- **Mystic engineering:** Sling Ring, levitation cloak, Crimson Bands, Mirror Dimension prism,
  Chronal Eye replica and reversible-looking reality fractures.
- **Cinematic WMDs:** Orbital Sky Lance, Celestial Nullifier, Singularity Warhead, Nanite
  Disassembler and Dimensional Breach Charge—spectacular effects with zero block mutation.
- **Machine-grade documentation:** every machine item states tier, branch, J/t, buffer, duration,
  batch size, input, output, hazard, containment and exact shutdown behavior.
- **Original branding:** production-ready icon and wide banner are included under `docs/assets`.

## Technology tree

### Cross-addon infrastructure

Recipes use registered Slimefun components rather than vanilla substitutes. Early engineering requires Basic and Advanced Circuit Boards, Electric Motors, Energy Regulators and Cargo Motors. Mid-game laboratories require Supreme Ventus power and Networks control hardware. Cosmic and universal programs consume Infinity circuits, capacitors, matrices and reactor infrastructure. At startup the addon resolves every dependency by stable Slimefun ID and logs the contributing addons; a missing required component fails registration visibly instead of silently making the recipe easier.


| Tier | Program | What it proves |
|---:|---|---|
| 0 | Salvaged Technology | Precision parts and basic control hardware |
| 1 | Stark Engineering | High-density coils and stable ARC power |
| 2 | Programmable Matter | Cleanroom synthesis and nanocell programming |
| 3 | Gamma Science | Radiation control, mutation safety and heavy containment |
| 4 | Exotic Materials | Synthetic vibranium, new element and techno-arcana |
| 5 | Cosmic Containment | Boss fragments, domain analysis and 500 MJ+ processes |
| 6 | Universal Engineering | Six artifacts, gauntlet platforms and the Universal Forge |

Difficulty comes from infrastructure, energy, hazards and boss-bound materials—not from asking for
five double chests of the same ingot.

## Machines that explain themselves

Single-block machines are `PLAYER_HEAD` items with a texture value and stable Slimefun/PDC identity.
They are designed to become proper electric processors in the next implementation pass while their
public contract is already stable. A machine description always answers:

1. What technology tier and branch is this?
2. How much power does it draw and buffer?
3. What enters, what exits, how long does it take and what is the batch size?
4. What hazard and containment level apply?
5. Why did it stop, and what exactly happens during failure?

See the complete [Machine Field Manual](docs/MACHINES.md).
See exact structures and shutdown rules in the [Multiblock Field Manual](docs/MULTIBLOCKS.md).
The public [Field Guide](docs/site/index.html) joins progression, operations, armor systems,
storage networking, gauntlets, safety and troubleshooting in one player-facing route.

## Safety is part of the fantasy

- Players are never valid Repulsor, shield, Unibeam, cataclysm or Snap targets.
- No ability calls Bukkit block explosions.
- Every large-area weapon scans WorldGuard and ProtectionStones before rendering or damaging.
- A configurable 24-block buffer rejects use near any protected region, including the user's own.
- Protection lookup errors fail closed: the weapon aborts instead of guessing that an area is safe.
- Cosmic exposure damages only the person deliberately holding the bare artifact.
- Effects use bounded loops and do not load chunks.
- Stable IDs use Slimefun/PDC, never display names.
- WorldGuard, ProtectionStones, NPC and grave adapters are explicit roadmap gates before destructive
  mining or large-area abilities can be enabled.

## Requirements

- Java 21
- Paper 1.21.11
- Drakes Slimefun Core 11.0 (`Slimefun` plugin)

Optional integrations planned or detected: WorldGuard, ProtectionStones, DrakesBosses and
DrakesArcana.

## Build

```bash
mvn clean verify
```

The Drakes Slimefun Core artifact must be available in Maven Local. On the Drakes development
workspace it is installed from `Slimefun4-Drake` with `mvn -DskipTests install`.

## Roadmap

- **0.2 Heroes and House of Stark:** real energy storage, suit-up sequences, Spider traversal,
  tactical arrow cartridges, flight heat, Unibeam, shields, War Machine and Rescue.
- **0.3 Gamma Protocol:** operating processors, exposure storage, controlled Banner mutation,
  Hulkbuster modules and gamma boss drops.
- **0.4 Sovereign Technologies:** Wakandan kinetic weave, Doom forge, Doombots, Ultron encounters,
  synthezoids and mystic engineering.
- **0.5 Infinity:** six independent boss chains, capsules, gauntlet GUI, safe PvE Snap and audit log.
- **0.6 Beyond Time:** Pym/Kang engineering, temporal anchors and the Universal Forge.

The catalog now covers 158 distinct registered entries; releases remain chapter-based so
every recipe, PDC state, protection boundary and effect budget can be tested before production.
